"""Build interpreted_cells_by_bracket.csv for upload to Google Earth Engine.

The CKIT-RF interpretation records in this repo are the classified rasters under
data/raw/rf_class_maps/. Each filename encodes the reviewer, the grid cell id, the sample index,
the sensor, the target year, and the NAIP bracket, for example:

    rf_class_reviewer_bekka_grid_10333_sample_41_sensor_Sentinel-2_target_2018_opt_2017_2019.tif

The opt_<YYYY>_<YYYY> field is the NAIP bracket and already uses the requested string form, so the
bracket mapping is the identity for the five in-scope brackets. This script parses every filename,
maps each record to (cell_id, bracket), collapses double-interpreted cells to one row per bracket,
and writes the CSV plus a companion note. cell_id is the grid id zero-padded to a width-5 string so
it joins cleanly against the GEE asset grid_112_naip_brackets_5_11_26.
