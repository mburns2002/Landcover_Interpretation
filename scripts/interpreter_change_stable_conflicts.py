"""Change/stable conflicts between interpreters: one reviewer called a pixel change and the other
called it stable (and vice versa).

Using the RF interpreted scheme, the change classes are Harvest (20), Development (30),
Insect/Disease (50) and Beaver (62), and the stable classes are Urban (0), Agriculture (1),
Grass/Shrub (2), Forest (3), Water (4), Wetland (5) and Other (13). Fire (40) has zero pixels.
Unknown (10) is unattributed disturbance, not a stable class and not one of the four attributed
change classes, so an Unknown-vs-stable disagreement is one reviewer flagging disturbance without
attributing it; it is excluded from the conflict count and reported separately.

This is the change-vs-stable counterpart of the change/change analysis and is expected to be much
larger, since the inter-interpreter matrix shows most change-class disagreement goes to stable
classes, not to other change classes.

For every double-interpreted cell (two reviewers on the same grid/sample/target, reviewer order
alphabetical and therefore arbitrary) this finds pixels where one reviewer assigned an attributed
change class and the other a stable class, and reports:
  - total conflict pixels and area, as a fraction of all disagreement and of all change-labeled px
  - directed A-class -> B-class pair counts, plus the symmetrized stable<->change counts
  - which cells and reviewer pairs the conflicts occur in (long-format table)
  - 8-connected component patches: count, median and max area

Outputs -> reports/interpreter_agreement/change_stable_conflicts/
  - change_stable_pixels_long.csv   one row per (cell, revA, revB, A_class, B_class)
  - ordered_pairs.csv               directed and symmetrized stable/change class-pair totals

These files flag pixels where one interpreter called a pixel an attributed change class and the
other called it a stable class (in either direction). Change classes are {chg}. Stable classes are
{stb}. Unknown (10) is unattributed disturbance and is neither stable nor an attributed change
class, so Unknown-vs-stable is reported separately in `summary.txt`, not counted as a conflict;
Fire (40) has zero pixels. See `summary.txt` for the headline totals and `ordered_pairs.csv` for
the directed and symmetrized class-pair totals.

## change_stable_pixels_long.csv  ({n_long} rows)

One row per (cell, reviewer pair, directed class pair). It depicts, for each double-interpreted
cell that has any change/stable conflict, how many pixels each ordered A-class -> B-class conflict
covers, where exactly one of the two classes is stable and the other is an attributed change
class. A cell with several conflicting class pairs gets several rows. Reviewer A/B ordering is
alphabetical and therefore arbitrary, so a single directed pair carries no meaning on its own; the
`stable_class` and `change_class` columns give the reviewer-order-independent view, and the
symmetrized totals are in `ordered_pairs.csv`.

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| grid | grid cell id (the physical cell) |
| sample | interpretation sample index for that cell |
| target | interpreted target year |
| revA | reviewer A (alphabetically first of the pair) |
| revB | reviewer B (alphabetically second) |
| A_class | the class reviewer A assigned to these pixels (stable or change) |
| B_class | the class reviewer B assigned to the same pixels (the other kind) |
| class_pair | `A_class->B_class`, the directed conflict label |
| stable_class | the stable class of the pair, regardless of which reviewer assigned it |
| change_class | the attributed change class of the pair, regardless of reviewer |
| pixels | number of conflict pixels of this class pair in this cell |
| area_ha | pixels x 0.01 ha (one 10 m pixel = 0.01 ha) |

## change_stable_patches.csv  ({n_patches} rows)

One row per connected-component patch of the change/stable conflict mask, labeled per cell with
8-connectivity. It depicts the spatial grouping of the conflicts: whether they are a handful of
large blobs or many scattered pixels. A patch is a spatially contiguous run of conflict pixels
within one cell and reviewer pair, so patch counts and areas distinguish "a few large disagreed
zones" from "boundary or salt-and-pepper speckle."

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| grid | grid cell id the patch is in |
| revA | reviewer A (alphabetically first) |
| revB | reviewer B (alphabetically second) |
| patch_id | patch label within this cell and reviewer pair (1-based) |
| pixels | number of conflict pixels in the patch |
| area_ha | pixels x 0.01 ha |
